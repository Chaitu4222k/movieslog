This is a web page I designed to log the time at which you watched movies.
You just need to enter the movie name and D&T and click submit so that you can see the log entered in the table.
In this page you can see what are the best trilogies and what are the top rated movies according to IMDB.
*Not yet completed. Need to add sql and few changes in it.
